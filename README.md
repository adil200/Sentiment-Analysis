# Sentiment Analysis on Airline Reviews

Welcome to the "Sentiment Analysis on Airline Reviews" project! This repository focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of airline reviews using the VADER sentiment analysis tool from the NLTK library.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook (`sentiment-analysis-on-airline-reviews.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on airline reviews using the VADER sentiment intensity analyzer. The notebook loads the `Airline_Reviews.csv` dataset, processes each review, and assigns sentiment labels ("Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral") based on the sentiment score calculated by VADER. The sentiment scores are used to determine the sentiment label for each review.

## Installation

To run the code in the notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:

-   Python 3
-   pandas
-   nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas nltk
```
## Usage

1.  Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adil200/Sentiment-Analysis.git 
```
2.  Download the dataset (`Airline_Reviews.csv`) and place it in the project's root directory.
    
3.  Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `sentiment-analysis-on-airline-reviews.ipynb` notebook.
    
4.  Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform sentiment analysis on airline reviews and analyze the sentiment labels and scores.
    

## Results

After processing the reviews and performing sentiment analysis, you can observe the sentiment labels ("Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral") and sentiment scores for each review. A sample of the sentiment analysis results for the first 10 reviews is provided in the notebook.

## Acknowledgments

The code and techniques used in this project are inspired by the VADER sentiment analysis tool provided by the NLTK library and various resources on sentiment analysis.
